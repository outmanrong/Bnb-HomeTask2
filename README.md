Due to some reasons on sandbox, it can't let me pull request what I did. So I recreated this repository.

This a task which I did on part time. So mostly the propose is to share the structure and my thought on coding.

Goals:
1. CSS and make a good struture of the codes. (Whether the codes are clean enough. How the browser justify big window or small window.)
2. TypeScript. (In order to have some standard to code, typescript will be more strict.)
3. How easy let others to jumps to my code. (Good structure. Leave important comments.)

Details:
1. Different display with different width of brwoser.
2. Themeable.
3. Code on Typescript.

Not Done yet:
4. Test on Firefox.
5. localization.
6. consider the performance

Latest update:
version 1.0 -- HomeTask
Write the codes without Typescript first.
Write the first version with only easy css.
For the first version most concentrated on the CSS controle through different width of browser.
Based on Chrome for the moment.
Without any test.
Could be themeable now.
Later will do the restruction.

version 2.0 -- HomeTask2
Restucted by Typescript. New to typescript.
Not tested on Firefox yet.
